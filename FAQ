1.	What are RC airplanes?
•	Briefly explain what RC airplanes are, including the different types (e.g., electric, gas, nitro), their components, and how they are controlled.

2.	How do I get started with RC airplanes?
In an ideal world, there will be an RC club near you that welcomes beginners. They will have a suitable field, and other enthusiasts to help and inspire you. They can check your model is correctly set up, and connect your transmitter to an instructor's, so they can take over as necessary.
If you don't live near a suitable club, it is entirely possible to learn on your own. You will need to do a lot more research, and will probably crash several times but that doesn't need to be a serious set-back.
In either case, it's well worth spending an hour or two on an RC simulator. Even the free ones are good enough for learning the basics.
It is worth starting with a plane that is designed specifically for beginners. Something slow, stable and tough will be much more likely to survive until you're ready to upgrade.

2. What resources are there?
Lots of people have attempted to summarise everything a beginner needs to know, but they either have to leave a lot out, or go into so much detail that it becomes overwhelming.
The [BMFA "A Flying Start"](http://www.srcfc.org.uk/A%20Flying%20Start.pdf) booklet is a good attempt at the basics.
[RC Groups Beginner Training Area (Aircraft-Electric)](https://www.rcgroups.com/beginner-training-area-aircraft-electric-8/) is a forum with a huge amount of information and discussion, with 'sticky' posts at the top for the most important things.

3.	Where can I find information on RC airplane models?
•	List websites, forums, and other online resources where users can find information on different RC airplane models, including reviews, specifications, and user experiences.

4.	How do I choose the right RC airplane for me as a beginner?
There is no perfect beginner airplane. Small, light planes are more likely to survive crashing, but can be twitchy and get blown around by even a light wind. They're good if you're learning on your own and have the flexibility (and patience) to wait for calm weather. Larger models are more suitable for a club when you have an instructor to take over, but have to fly when you're both free.
Models with electronic stability assistance are much easier to fly, but are more expensive (and it can't prevent all crashes, such as getting stuck in a tree).
High-wing trainers are known for their stability and ease of control, making them ideal for beginners to learn the basics of flying RC airplanes. 
Here are a few popular options:
*.	HobbyZone Sport Cub S: This is a popular micro RTF. It has a durable construction, self-leveling technology known as SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) that helps prevent crashes.
*.	E-flite Apprentice STS: This is another popular RTF model that offers a more advanced option for beginners. It features a larger wingspan and more powerful motor, allowing for smoother and more stable flights. It also includes SAFE technology, and comes with a Spektrum DXe transmitter, which can be used with other Spektrum receivers for future planes.
*.  E-flite Aeroscout S2 1.1m: Similar to the Apprentice except less realistic appearance. The propeller is behind the wing, so it (and the motor) is less likely to be damaged in a crash.
*.	FMS Sky Trainer 182: This is a scale model of the Cessna 182, known for its realistic looks and smooth flying characteristics. It's available in both RTF and PNP (Plug-N-Play) versions, and offers a great balance between stability and performance for beginners.
*.	Flyzone Sensei FS: This is a versatile trainer plane that comes in both RTF and PNP versions. It offers a durable foam construction, brushless motor, and flaps for improved control during takeoff and landing. It also has a large wingspan for added stability and is capable of aerobatics once you gain more experience.
It's important to choose a beginner-friendly RC airplane that matches your skill level and interests, and always follow the manufacturer's recommendations and safety guidelines. Additionally, consider joining online communities, such as the subreddit for RC airplanes, to connect with experienced users who can provide further advice and support as you start your RC flying journey.

4. What's the difference between RTF, BNF, PNP, and ARTF?
* RTF (Ready-to-Fly) comes with everything you need to get started, including a transmitter, receiver, battery, and charger.
* BNF (Bind-aNd-Fly) comes with a receiver, for people who already have a transmitter (of the right protocol), batteries and charger. Ideal when adding to your fleet.
* PNP (Plug-aNd-Play) No receiver. For people who use a different protocol radio to the one used by the plane manufacturer.
* ARTF (Almost-Ready-To-Fly). These often don't come with any electronics, but construction is still just gluing a few large foam pieces together. Ideal if you have lots of electronics salvaged from a previous model.


4. How do I choose a battery charger?
The chargers that come with RTF planes are very basic. Typically they only work for one size of battery, and they don't give any feedback. Good chargers will work with a range of battery chemistry, voltages and currents, and will report on charging progress and state of balance.
The iMax B6 has been the most popular first charger for about 15 years, but is starting to look a bit dated now. It will probably work for most people but is less powerful than modern chargers.
iDST and Toolkit both make good modern chargers. They are small but powerful, with a nice modern interface. Even their cheapest chargers are adequate for most people.
The extra power is useful as it allows you to charge multiple batteries at the same time, with a parallel charging board. While the 50W iMax B6 might be limited to 2 or 3 batteries, a 200W charger could charge 6-10 batteries.
You can buy chargers that run either from AC (mains) or DC (such as a car battery). DC chargers allow you to use the charger in the field, when you're flying. Old laptop power supplies work well for to power them, if you have one, or you can buy a DC power supply for about the difference between an AC and DC charger.
XT60 is by far the most popular battery connector at the moment but some batteries come without a plug, so you can add your own.


4. What transmitter should I buy?
If you buy a RTF plane, the transmitter it comes with will be very basic. Even if it could work with another model, converting from one to another is not a simple process that you can do between flights. So an RTF transmitter might make sense if your initial budget is limited, but you'll want something better quite soon. Many people decide to start with a transmitter that will last a few years.
Traditional RC manufacturers offer a range of radios, from a basic 6 channel radio with basic features, up to expensive models with more channels and more features. However over the last 10 years, Open Source firmware has been available, allowing manufactuers to offer radios with all the features of a high-end model, for the price of a low-end model.
* Jumper, RadioMaster and FrSky offer open source radios. These all have similar firmware features, with the hardware offering a choice of form factor, screen size, gimbal quality and battery size. They are available in 'multi-protocol' variant that are compatible with Spektrum and FlySky receivers. ELRS variants are for flying beyond visual range, and not normally for beginners.
* FlySky have simple, low end radios that are good enough for most people, but are now similar price to the cheapest open source radios.
* Spektrum used to be the market leader, but even their 'economy' DX6e is more expensive than the best open source radios. Their DXS transmitter that is supplied with RTF models only adds about $20 to the price of the model, so is a reasonable low-cost entry point, if you don't mind upgrading in a few months. Unlike almost all other brands, Spektrum have quite good service and support.

14.1 How do I repair crash damage to a foam plane? 
Foam planes can be repaired fairly easily, even after catastrophic crashes. First, collect all the little bits of foam (you might want to include a trash bag in your field kit). 
If the foam is badly crushed, you can expand it with gentle heat. Hot (not boiling) water is ideal. Some people immerse the foam in a pan or bath, others wrap the foam in a towel and soak it. This method can cause the surface beads to expand and lose the smooth finish, but you can use a warm iron to flatten them.
Many different types of glue work on foam, and it's (usually) not disolved by the solvents. Hot glue is good for quick fixes, UHU POR is designed for foams that are attacked by solvents, but for the strongest repair of badly cracked foam, use Gorilla glue.  It expands, forcing its way into cracks and filling gaps, and is very, very sticky. In dry weather, you may need to moisten one side of the joint to activate the glue. Be prepared to wipe up the excess every 10 minutes or so for at least an hour as it oozes out.
If the repair still feels a bit flexible, you can reinforce it by cutting a shallow slot and glueing in a cocktail stick or bamboo skewer.
